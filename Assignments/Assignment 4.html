        <h1 id="COMPUTER"> COMPUTER</h1>
        <P> 
            A computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program, software, <br>
        or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed.</P>

        <h2>CPU</h2>
        <p>The component of a computer system that controls the interpretation and execution of instructions. The CPU of a PC consists of a single microprocessor, <br>
         while the CPU of a more powerful mainframe consists of multiple processing devices, and in some cases, hundreds of them.
         The definition of CPU stands for <br>
        central processing unit, which is the control center of a computer. An example of a An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a key component of a computer's central processor unit. 
        
        <h2>ALU</h2>
        <p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a key component of a computer's central processor unit. The ALU performs all  <br>
        arithmetic and logic operations that must be performed on instruction words. The ALU is split into two parts in some microprocessor architectures: the AU and the LU.</p>

     <h2>c</h2>
     <P>C is a structured, procedural programming language that has been widely used both for operating systems and applications and that has had a wide following in 
        the academic community.</p>

    <h2>c <sup>++</sup></h2>
    <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
        
        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. <br>
        
        The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. 
        C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a general-purpose programming and coding language. C++ is used in developing browsers, operating systems, and applications, as well as in-game programming, <br>
         software engineering, data structures, etc</p>
